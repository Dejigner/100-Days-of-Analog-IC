# 100-Days-of-Analog-IC
Starting today, the 17th of January 2026, I will start learning, applying, exploring, simulating and more in the Analog IC design field. I will try to learn or create daily, may report daily or weekly about the whole week. Rules and more details in README file.

I am doing this to enhance my skills in this field and be ready for the Graduation Project and the competitive job market that requires skilled workforce. Also to prove that I am capable, since I have faced multiple rejections when applying to internsips and training. Of course I am not starting out proficient, and there are engineers out htere that out skill me, but I will be irreplacable.

The 100 days challenge is just a start to kickstart and will continue after that, whether in the same or different way, depending on the circumstances or what I need and what I have learnt. Maybe I will be able to land an internship, where this challenge will look a bit different then.

## Learning Resources:
- Books
- Research Papers
- Courses
- Youtube Playlists
- Top Universities' open source Material
- Repos
- Documentation

## Note on AI usage:
- AI usage will be limited to prohibited depending on application. In writing documentation, learning, simulating or any learning process step AI will be prohibited until I pass those first steps and build solid foundations properly. Only then, AI will be a great tool, but I have to learn first.
- The only allowed AI usage is when it doesn't interfere with the main learning process, like checking for grammar errors using Grammarly.
- AI is allowed to edit commit messages, autocreate them, depending on context. Since this doesn't interfere with me learning about Analog IC, and will save some time and will put clarity for the reader, for things I already know.
- It can also be used in suggesting better learning approaches and resources. It may be used in end results validation, probably until finding a mentor and working on actual projects.

## PS There are way other things that I will learn on the way including but not limited to:
- Learning how to properly write this README with no AI auto generation
- Learn more of the version control
- Enhancing search skills, reading, and finding the required. Really learning not copying and pasting. (Since AI use is limited in this challenge)
- Time managemnt and commitment to contribute or learn something new for a long time span.
- Enhancin writing and English skills over all
- Communication skills, where I will know how to communicate my thoughts and ideas through words and applications
