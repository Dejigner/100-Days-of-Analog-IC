# 100-Days-of-Analog-IC
Starting today, the 17th of January 2026, I will start learning, applying, exploring, simulating and more in the Analog IC design field. I will try to learn or create daily, may report daily or weekly about the whole week. Rules and more details in README file.

I am doing this to enhance my skills in this field and be ready for the Graduation Project and the competitive job market that requires skilled workforce. Also to prove that I am capable, since I have faced multiple rejections when applying to internsips and training. Of course I am not starting out proficient, and there are engineers out htere that out skill me, but I will be irreplacable.

The 100 days challenge is just a start to kickstart and will continue after that, whether in the same or different way, depending on the circumstances or what I need and what I have learnt. Maybe I will be able to land an internship, where this challenge will look a bit different then.

## Learning Resources:
- Books
- Research Papers
- Courses
- Youtube Playlists
- Top Universities' open source Material
- Repos
- Documentation

## Note on AI usage:
AI usage will be limited to prohibited depending on application. In writing documentation, learning, simulating or any learning process step AI will be prohibited until I pass those first steps and build solid foundations properly. Only then, AI will be a great tool, but I have to learn first.
The only allowed AI usage is when it doesn't interfere with the main learning process, like checking for grammar errors using Grammarly.

## PS There are way other things that I will learn on the way including but not limited to:
- Learning how to properly write this README with no AI auto generation
- Learn more of the version control
- Enhancing search skills, reading, and finding the required. Really learning not copying and pasting. (Since AI use is limited in this challenge)
- Time managemnt and commitment to contribute or learn something new for a long time span.
- Enhancin writing and English skills over all
- Communication skills, where I will know how to communicate my thoughts and ideas through words and applications
